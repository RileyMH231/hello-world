# hello-world
Finally getting serious about my future tech career.

Computer science major not currently enrolled in school, so am self-teaching.

Been through a Java 9 masterclass but am currently preparing for certification in Java 11.

This go around I'm trying to fold my coursework and practice into GitHub and begin focusing more on applying Java to development.

I'm also getting started with Swift 5.

I'm knowlegable enough in web development to get through basic and intermediate projects using MDN, but have yet to develop a site to host on my domain.

Have dabbled in using homebrew software on some of my hardware. Custom router firmware has been helpful, but the thing I've done so far that I'm most proud of was when I hacked my Nintendo Wii into copying inserted games to an external hard drive without bricking it.

Currently in the process of planning my first custom PC build.
